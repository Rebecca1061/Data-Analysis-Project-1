# Excel-Call-Center-Dashboard
In this data analyst project with Excel, we'll preprocess data in Excel and change them to preferred data types.
We have the following the dasboard:
1)3 KPI’s which list the number of calls in total, the average customer satisfaction score and the average call duration in minutes. 
2)Below them we have a line chart to show the trend of calls during October(that’s the only month available, the dataset is basically information about calls made in October 2020), a 
   doughnut chart to show through which channel the call was made.
3)Then we have a map,a column chart for the reason the person called and last but not least, a bar chart indicating the response time.
